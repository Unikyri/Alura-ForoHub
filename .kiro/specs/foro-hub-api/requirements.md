# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ForoHub is a REST API for a digital forum platform inspired by the needs of Alura students. The API will allow users to create, read, update, and delete topics, as well as interact with responses, users, and courses. The system will implement secure authentication using JWT tokens and follow OWASP ASVS Level 1 security standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Registration and Authentication

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register in the system and authenticate myself, so that I can participate in the forum discussions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides valid registration data (name, email, password) THEN the system SHALL create a new user account with hashed password
2. WHEN a user attempts to register with an existing email THEN the system SHALL return an error message
3. WHEN a user provides valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL return a JWT token for authentication
4. WHEN a user provides invalid login credentials THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error
5. WHEN a JWT token expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication

### Requirement 2: Topic Management for Authenticated Users

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to create, view, update, and delete my own topics, so that I can ask questions and manage my forum content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user creates a topic with valid data (title, message, course) THEN the system SHALL store the topic and associate it with the user
2. WHEN an authenticated user requests their own topics THEN the system SHALL return a list of topics created by that user
3. WHEN an authenticated user updates their own topic THEN the system SHALL save the changes and update the modification timestamp
4. WHEN an authenticated user attempts to update another user's topic THEN the system SHALL deny the operation
5. WHEN an authenticated user deletes their own topic THEN the system SHALL remove the topic and all associated responses
6. WHEN an authenticated user attempts to delete another user's topic THEN the system SHALL deny the operation

### Requirement 3: Public Topic Viewing

**User Story:** As any user (authenticated or not), I want to view topics and their details, so that I can read forum discussions and find information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user requests the topics list THEN the system SHALL return all topics with pagination and sorting by creation date
2. WHEN any user requests a specific topic by ID THEN the system SHALL return the topic details including all responses
3. WHEN a user requests a non-existent topic THEN the system SHALL return a not found error
4. WHEN the topics list is requested THEN the system SHALL include topic metadata (title, author, creation date, course, status)

### Requirement 4: Response Management

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to create, update, and delete responses to topics, so that I can participate in discussions and help other users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user creates a response to an existing topic THEN the system SHALL store the response and associate it with the user and topic
2. WHEN an authenticated user updates their own response THEN the system SHALL save the changes
3. WHEN an authenticated user attempts to update another user's response THEN the system SHALL deny the operation
4. WHEN an authenticated user deletes their own response THEN the system SHALL remove the response
5. WHEN a topic author marks a response as solution THEN the system SHALL update the response status and topic status

### Requirement 5: Course and User Profile Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage courses and user profiles, so that topics can be properly categorized and users can have appropriate permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL have predefined courses available for topic categorization
2. WHEN a user is created THEN the system SHALL assign a default user profile
3. WHEN a topic is created THEN it SHALL be associated with a valid course
4. WHEN user profiles are queried THEN the system SHALL return appropriate permission levels

### Requirement 6: Security and Data Protection

**User Story:** As a system stakeholder, I want the API to be secure and protect user data, so that the platform is safe and complies with security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user passwords are stored THEN the system SHALL hash them using BCrypt algorithm
2. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL validate JWT tokens for protected resources
3. WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all inputs
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log security events without exposing sensitive information
5. WHEN users access resources THEN the system SHALL enforce proper authorization controls
6. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL prevent SQL injection attacks through parameterized queries

### Requirement 7: API Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want the system to be performant and reliable, so that I can build applications that depend on it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN topics are listed THEN the system SHALL implement pagination to handle large datasets
2. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL use efficient indexing and query optimization
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes
4. WHEN the API is under load THEN the system SHALL maintain reasonable response times
5. WHEN database migrations are needed THEN the system SHALL use Flyway for version control
